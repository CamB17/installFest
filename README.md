We're going to install most of the tools we'll use in this course onto your computer today.

The technologies to install fall into three categories, so we have three sets of instructions you should follow in order:

1. [Web Development Tools for Mac OS X](mac-dev-tools.md)
2. [Tools for Node.js and Express Stack](express-stack.md)
3. [Tools for Ruby on Rails Stack](ruby-on-rails-stack.md)

*In this context, "stack" refers to a group of technologies used together to create a web app.*

If you are unsure what to do or run into problems during installation, don't worry! It happens to every web developer at some point. Read any error messages, recheck the instructions, and ask for help.
